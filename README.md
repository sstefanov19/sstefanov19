# Hi, I'm Stefan 👋  

I like building things on the back end and understanding how they work under the hood.  
Lately I’ve been spending most of my time experimenting with small services, tinkering with databases, and reading about how big systems stay fast and reliable.

---

### What I'm up to
- Writing little projects to learn about concurrency, caching and replication
- Taking apart database features to see how they’re implemented
- Slowly building a tiny distributed key-value store as a learning exercise

---

### Things I use a lot
Java · Spring Boot · Node.js  
PostgreSQL 
Docker · REST APIs
